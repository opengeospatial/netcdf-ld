Prefix definitions provided explicitly within a file shall not be overwridden be context files.  Prefixes defined within a file have precedence.

If a prefix defined within a file is also defined within provided JSON-LD context files with different URI interpretations, then implementations shall ignore that JSON-LD context definition and treat the prefix as locally resolved.

This standard does not consider this as a parsing error.

Implementations may treat this condition as a warning condition and as a validation error within the provided context.
