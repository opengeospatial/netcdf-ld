// {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}

A netCDF file shall be provided along with its own identity, as a URI, external to the file contents.

If no identity is provided, then the path used by a library to access the file is used as a default identity.
If used, a local file URI will always use the '/' forward slash as an element separator, even on systems where local identifiers use back slash separators.

The identity of the root group shall always terminate in a '/' character.
