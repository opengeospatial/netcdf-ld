Each netCDF variable that is a bald:Array shall declare a shape statement.


A bald:array within the metadata graph shall include a statement defining the shape of the data payload array as a Literal encoded tuple of integer values, using bald:shape.  Integers are derived from references to named dimensions within the netCDF input file.

For example:

----
<variableURI> rdf:type bald:Array ;
              bald shape '(1,1,16,9)' .
----

If the bald:Array instance has a single dimension, then the first and last values from the data payload, as ordered within the netCDF file, shall be encoded as Literals within the metadata graph, using bald:firstValue and bald:lastValue.

For example:
----
<variableURI> rdf:type bald:Array ;
              bald shape '(72,)' ;
              bald:firstValue -90 ;
              bald:lastValue 90 .
----
