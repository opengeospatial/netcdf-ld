Each variable that is not itself a netCDF Coordinate Variable, that is defined with respect to a netCDF Coordinate Variable, shall be interpreted as a variable to variable reference from that variable to the netCDF Coordinate variable.

A netCDF Coordinate Variable is defined within the netCDF user guide as a one-dimensional variable with the same variable name as the only netCDF dimension with respect to which it is defined.
