NetCDF-LD is an approach for constructing Linked Data descriptions using the metadata 
and structures found in netCDF files. 
Linked Data is a set of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) best practices to allow structured data to be published 
so that it can be interlinked on the web and support semantic queries. 
Linked Data uses the W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF) to express the information and relationships.

NetCDF-LD enhances netCDF metadata, enabling information found in netCDF files 
to be linked with published conventions and controlled vocabularies used to express the content.

The netCDF  Linked Data standard: netCDF-LD provides 
the encoding standard for encoding linked data semantics into netCDF  files 
and interpreting netCDF  files as RDF graphs.

NetCDF  files may use the HDF5 based netCDF-4 encoding, which is 
limited to the netCDF  data model, or the legacy netCDF-3 encoding.
