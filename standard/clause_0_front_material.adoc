[big]*i.     Abstract*

netCDF is a format for encoding array-oriented scientific data, particularly in many Earth & Space Science domains, 
and is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard.
It is common practice to aid interoperability of netCDF files in the Earth sciences by using the Climate and Forecasting (CF) 
convention and also the Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD). 
Several communities are defining additional netCDF conventions for describing the semantics relating to their different domains. 
As the concurrent use of multiple, and possibly clashing or conflicting, netCDF conventions spreads, the challenge of finding a common mechanism 
to validate and interpret metadata embedded inside netCDF files grows.

Linked Data (LD) is a World Wide Web Consortium best practice for encoding and publishing metadata to expose and connect data both within individual datasets and across multiple datasets. 
LD also allows dataset descriptions to become more useful through the ability to run semantically-enabled queries across datasets. 
Publishing netCDF file descriptions using LD methods presents the user community with an opportunity to address this exposure and connection and, 
further, to enhance data findability and re-use.

The netCDF  Linked Data standard (netCDF-LD) provides 
the encoding standard for encoding linked data semantics into netCDF  files 
and interpreting netCDF files as RDF graphs.

[big]*iii.   Preface*

This encoding standard standardises a W3 RDF encoding for a graph derived from the metadata payload of a netCDF file.  This provides a mechanism to summarise and index individual netCDF files and to aggregate summaries across file sets and structured collections of identified files.

In providing these encoding mechanisms and rules, this standard provides a framework for publishers to define namespace qualified attributes for new metadata standards, enabling extended interoperability for using multiple complementary metadata scheme within a file and for existing standards to continue with their standardised terms. The standard also provides opportunity for publishers of metadata standards for netCDF files to publish standards specifications as machine parsable content for use within the parsing process.

The mechanisms standardised are deliberately generic, with detailed implementation to netCDF provided.  This gives the opportunity for future work, beyond the scope of this standard, to reuse aspects of the approach for content metadata extraction and aggregation for other file formats; for example HDF5 and GeoTIFF may be suitable targets for future standardisation work.
