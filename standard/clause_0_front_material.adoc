[big]*i.     Abstract*

netCDF is a format for encoding array-oriented scientific data, particularly in many Earth & Space Science domains, 
and is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard.
It is common practice to aid interoperability of netCDF files in the Earth sciences by using the Climate and Forecasting (CF) 
convention and also the Attribute Convention for Data Discovery (ACDD). 
Several communities are defining additional netCDF conventions for describing the semantics relating to their different domains. 
As the concurrent use of multiple, and possibly clashing or conflicting, netCDF conventions spreads, the challenge of finding a common mechanism 
to validate and interpret metadata embedded inside netCDF files grows.

Linked Data (LD) is a World Wide Web Consortium best practice for encoding and publishing metadata to expose and connect data both within individual datasets and across multiple datasets. 
LD also allows dataset descriptions to become more useful through the ability to run semantically-enabled queries across datasets. 
Publishing netCDF file descriptions using LD methods presents the user community with an opportunity to address this exposure and connection and, 
further, to enhance data findability and re-use.

The netCDF  Linked Data standard (netCDF-LD) provides 
the encoding standard for encoding linked data semantics into netCDF  files 
and interpreting netCDF files as RDF graphs.
