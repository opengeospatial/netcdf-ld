Information on the NetCDF Coordinate Variables' data payload, which are limited to 1 Dimensional variables of data, shall be included in created graphs.

The first value of the coordinate variable data payload shall be included in the created graph, using the predicate:

`bald:firstValue`

Optionally the last value, if there is more than one value, of the coordinate variable data payload shall be included in the created graph, using the predicate:

`bald:lastValue`


The first and last positions are taken from the order of the coordinate variable array values, as presented within the file.
