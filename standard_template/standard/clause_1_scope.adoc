== Scope

NetCDF-LD is an approach for constructing Linked Data descriptions using the metadata 
and structures found in netCDF files. 
Linked Data is a set of practices to allow structured data to be published 
so that it can be interlinked on the web and support semantic queries. 
It uses the W3 Resource Description Framework (RDF) to express the information and relationships.

NetCDF-LD enhances netCDF metadata, enabling information found in netCDF files 
to be linked with published conventions and controlled vocabularies used to express the content.

The netCDF Classic Linked Data standard: netCDF-Classic-LD provides 
the encoding standard for encoding linked data semantics into netCDF Classic files 
and interpreting netCDF Classic files as RDF graphs.

NetCDF Classic files may use the HDF5 based netCDF-4 encoding, as long as 
it is limited to the netCDF classic data model, or the legacy netCDF-3 encoding.
